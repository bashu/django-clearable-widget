Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install django-clearable-widget

External dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* jQuery - this is not included in the package since it is expected
  that in most scenarios this would already be available.

Setup
-----

Add ``clearable_widget`` to  ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'clearable_widget',
    )

and just include ``clearable_widget`` templates

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% include "clearable_widget/clearable_widget_css.html" %} {# Before the closing head tag #}
    {% include "clearable_widget/clearable_widget_js.html" %} {# Before the closing body tag #}

When deploying on production server, don't forget to run:

.. code-block:: shell

    python manage.py collectstatic

Usage
-----

All you need now is to import ``ClearableInput`` class and override
field's widget, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    from clearable_widget import ClearableInput

    class Form(forms.Form):

        field = forms.CharField(widget=ClearableInput)

Please see ``example`` application. This application is used to
manually test the functionalities of this package. This also serves as
a good example.

You need only Django 1.4 or above to run that. It might run on older
versions but that is not tested.
